### Sending form data

Objective: 	To understand what happens when form data is submitted, including getting a basic idea of how data is processed on the server

![Architecture](https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2012/11/20/4291/c1a4a06f1fd9ed42ec5b06e814dd3111/client-server.png)

        At it's most basic, the web uses a client/server architecture that can be summarized as follows. a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server (most of the time a web server like Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat, etc.), using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol.

### On the client side: defining how to send the data

The <form> element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button. The two most important attributes are action and method.

The action attribute defines where the data gets sent. Its value must be a valid relative or absolute URL. If this attribute isn't provided, the data will be sent to the URL of the page containing the form — the current page.

    <form action="https://example.com">

    <form action="/somewhere_else">

The names and values of the non-file form controls are sent to the server as name=value pairs joined with ampersands. The action value should be a file on the server that can handle the incoming data, including ensuring server-side validation. The server then responds, generally handling the data and loading the URL defined by the action attribute, causing a new page load (or a refresh of the existing page, if the action points to the same page).

### The method attribute

The method attribute defines how data is sent. The HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request; HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the GET method and the POST method

### The GET method

The GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server, I want to get this resource." In this case, the browser sends an empty body. Because the body is empty, if a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL.


    <form action="http://www.foo.com" method="GET">
      <div>
        <label for="say">What greeting do you want to say?</label>
        <input name="say" id="say" value="Hi">
      </div>
      <div>
        <label for="to">Who do you want to say it to?</label>
        <input name="to" id="to" value="Mom">
      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Send my greetings</button>
      </div>
    </form>
